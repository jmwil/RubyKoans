= Neo Ruby Koans

These are my answers to the Koans.


   The Ruby Koans walk you along the path to enlightenment in order to learn Ruby.
   The goal is to learn the Ruby language, syntax, structure, and some common
   functions and libraries. We also teach you culture by basing the koans on tests.
   Testing is not just something we pay lip service to, but something we
   live.  Testing is essential in your quest to learn and do great things in Ruby.
